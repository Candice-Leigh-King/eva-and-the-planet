          <p>Candy and Jonty took photos of my holiday home in Diani Beach,
          Kenya. <strong>The most memorable photo is used nowadays as a welcome
          card and our guests love it!</strong></p><p>Working with them was
          great from start to finish. They offered great advice on <strong>best
          shots for different uses (social media, advertisement, website
          etc).</strong></p><p>Besides the photos, the most important outcome of
          working with them is that they made me understand how to use social
          media to showcase my B&amp;B, for which I will be forever
          grateful.</p><p><strong>Very happy with the end result with positive
          feedback from travel agents and potential
          customers.</strong></p><p><strong>Highly recommended!</strong></p>

          <p>We were <strong>so lucky to work with Candy and the Kings</strong>
          at The Inside House- Chiang Mai. Working with them was a real joy.
          They are <strong>very professiona</strong>l, yet so creative.
          <strong>The contents they created are beyond what we have
          imagined</strong>. It was the pure work of art. They also gave us many
          recommendations for the social media strategies and planning. We are
          very pleased to have them with us, and <strong>will absolutely
          recommend for anyone</strong> interested in a fine collection of
          collaboration.</p>
