      long we retain your data&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you leave a comment, the
      comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
      recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of
      holding them in a moderation queue.</p><p>For users that register on our

      Information&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We share your Personal Information with
      service providers to help us provide our services and fulfill our
      contracts with you, as described above. For example:&nbsp;</p><p>● We use

      request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our
      rights.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Behavioral Advertising&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As
      described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with

      advertising partners, and in some cases through the use of cookies or
      other similar technologies (which you may consent to, depending on your
      location).&nbsp;</p><p>● We use Shopify Audiences to help us show ads on
      other websites with our advertising partners to buyers who made purchases
      with other Shopify merchants and who may also be interested in what we
      have to offer. We also share information about your use of the Site, your
      purchases, and the email address associated with your purchases with
      Shopify Audiences, through which other Shopify merchants may make offers
      you may be interested in.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information about how
