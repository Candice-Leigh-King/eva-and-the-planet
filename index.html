      <p><em><strong>About me</strong></em></p><p>I am Eva, a professional
      travel photographer and content creator from Germany shooting aerial
      footage with my drone.</p><p>After working for years in finance and
      product management, I decided to quit my old job in the summer of 2021 to
      leave for a 10-months travel adventure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>My
      drone photography</strong></em></p><p>My passion for drones evolved when I
      left for that trip around Southeast Asia and little did I know that I
      would instantly fall in love with drone photography and videography. The
      new perspectives and aerial views I got were
      fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing places from above for the first time that
      I&rsquo;ve visited before was such a unique experience. I've been
      traveling full-time around Southeast Asia and Europe ever since, gave up
      my life and apartment in Germany to capture the most beautiful sceneries
      with my drone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Life-changing
      experience</strong></em></p><p>Ever since I lived with a host family in
      the US for a year in 2004 I&rsquo;ve been curious about travel and
      exploring our beautiful world. Spending a year abroad as a teenager, going
      to Highschool in a different country, experiencing a new culture was
      definitely life-changing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>My
      values</i></b></p><p>I grew up to be conscious of the environment but
      traveling in the past years made me realise even more how crucial it is to
      protect our planet. I&rsquo;ve seen places transform, forests disappear,
      rivers and oceans full of plastic.</p><p>Ten years ago I decided to stop
      eating meat, and three years later I transformed to live 100% plant-based.
      This has been one of the best decisions of my life. I&rsquo;m fascinated
      by animals and how each creature has its unique capabilities as part of
      this incredible ecosystem we all live in. Choosing to eat plant-based
      gives animals a voice which they deserve. Not to mention the positive
      effect it has on the planet and personal
      health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>My
      mission</strong></em></p><p>After flying my drone for a while I knew I
      wanted to combine drone photography and videography with my love for
      nature. By showing the beautiful world we live in from above, I want to
      bring awareness to the importance of preserving it. My mission is to
      inspire others with my content to go out and see the world and its beauty
      to understand how important it is to protect it, so we all have something
      left to see and experience years ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Eva joined us for one of our 8 day sailing adventures around
          Phuket. She took some absolutely awesome footage, and turned it into
          media clips which still attract tons of attention. She&rsquo;s also
          fun, easy-going and flexible to work with. Highly recommended!</p>
