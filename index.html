      <p>Hi!</p><p>I am Eva, a professional drone photographer from
      Germany.&nbsp;</p><p>After working for years in finance and product
      management, I decided to leave my old job behind in the summer of 2021.
      I've been traveling full-time around Asia and Europe ever since, capturing
      the most beautiful scenery with my drone.&nbsp;</p><p>My passion for
      travel and exploring our beautiful world evolved back in 2004. Living with
      a host family in the US for a year as a teenager was a life-changing
      experience.</p><p>I grew up to be conscious of the environment and live a
      sustainable life. Ten years ago I decided to stop eating meat, and three
      years later I transformed to living 100% plant-based. This has been one of
      the best decisions of my life. I&rsquo;m fascinated by animals and how
      each creature has its unique capabilities as part of this incredible
      ecosystem we all live in. Choosing to eat plant-based gives animals a
      voice which they deserve. Not to mention the benefits for the environment
      and personal health.&nbsp;</p><p>I fell in love with drone photography and
      instantly knew I wanted to combine this new passion with my love for
      nature. By showing the beautiful world we live in from above, I want to
      bring awareness to the importance of preserving it. My mission is to
      inspire others with my content to go out and see the world and its beauty
      to understand how important it is to protect it, so we all have something
      left to see and experience years ahead.</p>

          <p>Eva joined us for one of our 8 day sailing adventures around
          Phuket. She took some absolutely awesome footage, and turned it into
          media clips which still attract tons of attention. She&rsquo;s also
          fun, easy-going and flexible to work with. Highly recommended!</p>
