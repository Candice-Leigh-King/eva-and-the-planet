      travel photographer and content creator from Germany shooting aerial
      footage with my drone.</p><p>After working for years in finance and
      product management, I decided to quit my old job in the summer of 2021 to
      leave for a 10-months travel adventure.</p>

      <p><b><i>My values</i></b></p><p>I grew up to be conscious of the
      environment but traveling in the past years made me realise even more how
      crucial it is to protect our planet. Iâ€™ve seen places transform, forests
      disappear, rivers and oceans full of plastic.</p><p>Ten years ago I
      decided to stop eating meat, and three years later I transformed to live
      100% plant-based. This has been one of the best decisions of my life. Iâ€™m
      fascinated by animals and how each creature has its unique capabilities as
      part of this incredible ecosystem we all live in. Choosing to eat
      plant-based gives animals a voice which they deserve. Not to mention the
      positive effect it has on the planet and personal health.</p><p>â€‹</p>

      want to bring awareness to the importance of preserving it. My mission is

          <p>Eva joined us for one of our 8 day sailing adventures around
          Phuket. She took some absolutely awesome footage, and turned it into
          media clips which still attract tons of attention. Sheâ€™s also fun,
          easy-going and flexible to work with. Highly recommended!</p>

          <p>We were <strong>so lucky to work with Candy and the Kings</strong>
          at The Inside House- Chiang Mai. Working with them was a real joy.
          They are <strong>very professiona</strong>l, yet so creative.
          <strong>The contents they created are beyond what we have
          imagined</strong>. It was the pure work of art. They also gave us many
          recommendations for the social media strategies and planning. We are
          very pleased to have them with us, and <strong>will absolutely
          recommend for anyone</strong> interested in a fine collection of
          collaboration.</p>

          <p>Candy and Jonty took photos of my holiday home in Diani Beach,
          Kenya. <strong>The most memorable photo is used nowadays as a welcome
          card and our guests love it!</strong></p><p>Working with them was
          great from start to finish. They offered great advice on <strong>best
          shots for different uses (social media, advertisement, website
          etc).</strong></p><p>Besides the photos, the most important outcome of
          working with them is that they made me understand how to use social
          media to showcase my B&amp;B, for which I will be forever
          grateful.</p><p><strong>Very happy with the end result with positive
          feedback from travel agents and potential
          customers.</strong></p><p><strong>Highly recommended!</strong></p>
