    textarea_html: "<p><em><strong>About me</strong></em></p><p>I am Eva, a professional travel photographer and content creator from Germany shooting aerial footage with my drone.</p><p>After working for years in finance and product management, I decided to quit my old job in the summer of 2021 to leave for a 10-months travel adventure.</p><p>\_</p><p><em><strong>My drone photography</strong></em></p><p>My passion for drones evolved when I left for that trip around Southeast Asia and little did I know that I would instantly fall in love with drone photography and videography. The new perspectives and aerial views I got were fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing places from above for the first time that Iâ€™ve visited before was such a unique experience. I've been traveling full-time around Southeast Asia and Europe ever since, gave up my life and apartment in Germany to capture the most beautiful sceneries with my drone.</p><p>â€‹â€‹</p><p><b><i>My values</i></b></p><p>I grew up to be conscious of the environment but traveling in the past years made me realise even more how crucial it is to protect our planet. Iâ€™ve seen places transform, forests disappear, rivers and oceans full of plastic.</p><p>Ten years ago I decided to stop eating meat, and three years later I transformed to live 100% plant-based. This has been one of the best decisions of my life. Iâ€™m fascinated by animals and how each creature has its unique capabilities as part of this incredible ecosystem we all live in. Choosing to eat plant-based gives animals a voice which they deserve. Not to mention the positive effect it has on the planet and personal health.</p><p>\_</p><p><em><strong>My mission</strong></em></p><p>After flying my drone for a while I knew I wanted to combine drone photography and videography with my love for nature. By showing the beautiful world we live in from above, I want to bring awareness to the importance of preserving it. My mission is to inspire others with my content to go out and see the world and its beauty to understand how important it is to protect it, so we all have something left to see and experience years ahead.</p><p>\_</p>"

          <p>Eva joined us for one of our 8 day sailing adventures around
          Phuket. She took some absolutely awesome footage, and turned it into
          media clips which still attract tons of attention. Sheâ€™s also fun,
          easy-going and flexible to work with. Highly recommended!</p>
